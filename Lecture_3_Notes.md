# How the Internet Works

### 1. Internet

##

<h4>⭐ What is Internet?</h4>

- Internet is a global system where billions of devices & other resources are interconnected with each other.

- Internet is a **Global System/ Network of Networks**

#

### 2. History of Internet

##

- 1960 - **ARPANET**(The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)

They want to send big file in the form of small packets in their destination.

- 1970 - Organization using internet in big scale.
- 1980 - **DNS**(Domain Name System)/**WWW**
- 1990 - Commercial Websites, Email etc
- 2000 - Facebook & Mobile Era.
- Today - **AI** (We can do everything through Internet).

#

### 3. Need of Address

- If you want to communicate with other machine you need an **IP Address**.

#

### 4. Client - Service Modal

- The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between **the providers (servers) and service requesters (clients)**. It is commonly used in computer applications such as email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

### 5. Protocol Stack and Packets

- Let's take an example if a one machine sending **100MB** File to another machine it will be sended in the form of small packets and re-unite in the destination.

- Protocol is a set of rules to follow
- TCP defines PORT Number
- IP will defines it address and added to Hardware.

### 6. How Packet travels?

- Client wants to send request through a **router** then your **ISP** get the IP Address and recall itself that I know this IP Address, then it goes to server using multiple routers.

### Let's learn this thing in more depth:

- Three Layers of ISP:
  - Local ISP
  - Regional ISP
  - NSP (National Service Provider) 

### 7. Router & Routing Table

- Router: A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions **between networks and on the global Internet**

- Routing Table: A routing table is a data table stored in a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations, and in some cases, metrics (distances) associated with those routes.
